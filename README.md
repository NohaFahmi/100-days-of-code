## About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Code Challenge is a commitment to code for at least an hour every day for 100 days. It's a great way to build consistency in coding practice and make significant progress in your skills and projects, learn more about it [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

## Daily Logs

I'll be maintaining a daily log in tabular format to track my progress. Each entry will include the day number, date, what I worked on, any thoughts or reflections, and a link to the code or files.

For a detailed log, please refer to the [daily log table](log.md).
